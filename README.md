March 2023 recorded the highest sales, primarily driven by the Offline Agent mode, followed by Offline Direct.

Offline Agent has consistently been the leading revenue channel since inception.

In contrast, Offline Direct and Online Website channels have shown weaker performance, possibly due to lower engagement or reach.

Sales Channel Share:

Offline Agent: 55.41%

Online App: 16.03%

🛡️ **Policy Performance**

Policy POL4321HEL attracted the most customers (4,344) but contributed relatively low revenue (₹33.05M).

👥 **Age Group Analysis:**

![age group view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa2e293b-14db-49b9-b378-a77f4b8ad048)

The 31–40 age group represents the largest customer base, with 10,460 customers, primarily associated with Offline Agent and Offline Direct sales modes.

There is minimal engagement through Online App and Online Website, suggesting a digital gap in this segment.

Age 41–50: ₹128.43M

🛡️ **Policy Highlight**

Policy POL2005HEL stands out with the highest revenue under the Above 65 age group, totaling ₹117.49M, despite not having the highest customer count—indicating high-value customers in that segment.





![Age group1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aa722f4-14c4-4bc9-9c05-57c99582771c)

The overall expected settlement rate stands at 61.89%.

The highest settlement rate is observed in the Above 65 age group at 74.33%, followed by:

51–65: 65.35%

41–50: 60.79%

Younger age groups show lower settlement expectations:

31–40: 53.53%

25–30: 45.68%

18–24: only 37.51%

This trend suggests higher claim settlement expectations among older customers, which may reflect greater policy maturity or possibly higher trust in claim processes. The 18–40 segment may require more engagement or process clarity to improve confidence and satisfaction

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ **Conclusion:**

Shield Insurance has shown strong performance in revenue and customer acquisition, especially during March 2023 and December 2022, driven largely by Offline Agent sales. The 31–40 age group emerged as the largest customer segment and the highest revenue contributor, highlighting the importance of targeted engagement for this demographic.

However, despite high customer numbers, expected settlement rates are lower for younger age groups, particularly 18–40, suggesting a need for improved transparency or service in claims processing. In contrast, the Above 65 group, though smaller in size, has the highest settlement expectations, possibly indicating greater trust or more mature policies.

We have also few policies like POL4321HEL ,which had high cutomer count of 4,344 that contributed only 33.05M in revenue.This could be because customer tend to opt for more affordable, lower-coverage policies. Additionally, underperformance of digital sales channels like Online App and Website may suggest missed opportunities in upselling or offering higher-value products. Addressing these gaps through better product positioning, personalized upselling, and improving digital channel performance could help increase revenue per customer.
